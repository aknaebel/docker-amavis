# daemonized and equivalent or similar command-line scanners available,
# it is customary to place slower command-line scanners in the
# @av_scanners_backup list. The default choice is somewhat arbitrary,
# move entries from one list to another as desired, keeping main scanners
# in the primary list to avoid warnings.
